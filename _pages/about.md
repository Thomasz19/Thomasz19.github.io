Welcome! I’m Thomas Zoldowski, an undergraduate in Computer Engineering at Grand Valley State University. This portfolio highlights selected projects that showcase my technical skills, problem-solving approach, and growth as an engineer.

Beyond engineering, I’ve been shaped by my background as a student-athlete. I was a member of the varsity swim team at GVSU, where I competed at a high level and earned All-American honors (Top 16 nationally) during both my junior and senior years. Swimming has taught me discipline, resilience, and how to perform under pressure, skills I carry into my academic and engineering work.

I’m passionate about embedded systems, electronics, and hands-on design, but I also enjoy staying active, taking on new challenges, and continuously learning.

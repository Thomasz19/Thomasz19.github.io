This project involved the design and implementation of a functional vending machine using an STM32F446RE microcontroller. The system supported real-world vending interactions including coin detection via infrared sensors, product selection using a 4x3 matrix keypad, and servo motor-controlled product dispensing.

An LCD interface provided real-time user feedback, while an RGB LED indicated status (e.g., ready, error, low inventory). The embedded firmware, written in C, managed a state machine for input handling, fund validation, inventory tracking, and administrative access secured by a PIN code.

Additional features included internal temperature monitoring and a hidden admin menu for restocking and cash tracking. The enclosure was custom-designed using CAD and 3D printing. This project demonstrated strong skills in embedded software, sensor integration, and user interface design.
